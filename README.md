# AeroFS SDK (Python)

The `aerofs-sdk-python` project is an AeroFS Private Cloud API SDK written in
Python. It currently supports both a one-to-one mapping of API routes to
SDK functionality as well as an object-based abstraction of API resources.

This SDK is up-to-date as of API v1.3.

## Installation

For production, use `pip install aerofs`.

For development, run `python setup.py develop`. You may wish to do so in a
[virtual environment](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

## Usage

See the `examples/` folder.
